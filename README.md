# littleosbook Code

While reading [the little book about OS development](https://littleosbook.github.io/), I worked through the exercises they posed and put together pieces of an operating system as they suggested. This is the result of working through those exercises.

## Purpose

The final product of this repository is intended to be a minimal, rudimentary, working toy operating system and its kernel written in **ANSI C** and **Assembly** with absolutely no standard libraries and no preceding code, i.e. an operating system built from scratch.

There is *no* presumption for any elements of a computer apart from it being an x86 architecture, possessing your usual hardware such as a framebuffer to allow writing to the screen, and any such other devices.

## Disclaimer

This is not a truly working or productive operating system for any reasonable development environment. This operating system is for educational purposes only.
